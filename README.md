# Images Processing(Just Python, Numpy, Cython)

This proceject is to compare performace of differences filters(Gaussian Filter, Sobel Filter, Median Filter), The main goal is to explore how fundamental image filters work under the hood, including Gaussian blurring, edge detection with Sobel filters, and noise reduction with median filters.



## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of different image processing techniques using pure Python, NumPy, and NumPy with Cython for optimization. The notebook implements three main filters:

- Pure Python (without Numpy)
- NumPy (using matrix operations for optimization)
- NumPy + Cython (optimizing with compiled C functions)

## Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

- numpy (for array operations and vectorization)

- cv2 (OpenCV for image handling)

- cython (for performance optimization)
